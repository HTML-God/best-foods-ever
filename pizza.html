<h3>recipe:</h3>
<h3>•In a glass or plastic bowl, combine yeast, water, and sugar (the water can just be water from the tap, make sure it's below 100°F).</h3>
<h3>•Stir to dissolve the yeast and let the yeast "bloom" for 15 minutes.</h3>
<h3>•Stir in 1 cup flour, add salt, and then stir in another cup of flour (the remaining cup of flour will be your "bench" flour and added flour).</h3>
<h3>•Dump mixture onto kneading board and work in last cup of flour, kneading until dough is soft and elastic, but not sticky. Form dough into a ball.</h3>
<h3>•In another bowl, pour in the 1 tbsp olive oil and spread around.</h3>
<h3>•Coat ball of dough with oil and cover bowl with a damp towel and let dough rise for 40 minutes.</h3>
<h3>•Punch down dough and knead on board about 2 minutes. Dough is now ready to spread in the pan.</h3>
<h3>•To avoid sticking of crust, lightly spray pizza pan with olive oil or vegetable oil spray and then work dough to pan (or use free form pan) - this dough is enough for 1 14-in pizza with a thin bottom crust and enough dough around the edge to munch.</h3>
<h3>•Combine pureed tomatoes, tomato paste, minced garlic, and basil.</h3>
<h3>•Spread onto prepared pizza dough.</h3>
<h3>•Top with sliced mozzarella cheese and bake at 500°F for 11-13 minutes.</h3>
